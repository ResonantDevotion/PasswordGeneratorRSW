# PasswordGeneratorRSW

## Brief
'Creating an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected'. Should be acheived by altering a starter code. It should have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Description 

This project was used to help us piece together the previous weeks advanced Javascript, which included methods, objects, nested arrays and different types of functions. It also provided an opportunity to pseudocode, practice researching, peer programming and work solo. 

I learnt that sometimes code can be a lot simpler than I would initially think, and that there are multiple ways of achieving the same goal. 

The deployed application can be found here at:
